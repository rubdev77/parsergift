class InputStorePaymentStarsTopup(TLObject):  # type: ignore
    """Used to top up the Telegram Stars balance of the current account.

    Constructor of :obj:`~hydrogram.raw.base.InputStorePaymentPurpose`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``223``
        - ID: ``F9A2A6CB``

    Parameters:
        stars (``int`` ``64-bit``):
            Amount of stars to topup

        currency (``str``):
            Three-letter ISO 4217 currency code

        amount (``int`` ``64-bit``):
            Total price in the smallest units of the currency (integer, not float/double). For example, for a price of US$ 1.45 pass amount = 145. See the exp parameter in currencies.json, it shows the number of digits past the decimal point for each currency (2 for the majority of currencies).

        spend_purpose_peer (:obj:`InputPeer <hydrogram.raw.base.InputPeer>`, *optional*):
            Should be populated with the peer where the topup process was initiated due to low funds (i.e. a bot for bot payments, a channel for paid media/reactions, etc); leave this flag unpopulated if the topup flow was not initated when attempting to spend more Stars than currently available on the account's balance.
