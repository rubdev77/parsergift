        user_id (:obj:`InputUser <hydrogram.raw.base.InputUser>`):

        charge_id (``str``):

        restore (``bool``, *optional*):
            If not set, disables autorenewal of the subscriptions, and prevents the user from reactivating the subscription once the current period expires: a subscription cancelled by the bot will have the starsSubscription.bot_canceled flag set.  The bot can can partially undo this operation by setting this flag: this will allow the user to reactivate the subscription.
