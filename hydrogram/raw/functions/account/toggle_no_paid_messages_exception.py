class ToggleNoPaidMessagesException(TLObject):  # type: ignore

    Details:
        - Layer: ``223``
        - ID: ``FE2EDA76``

    Parameters:
        user_id (:obj:`InputUser <hydrogram.raw.base.InputUser>`):
            The user to exempt or unexempt.

        refund_charged (``bool``, *optional*):
            If set and require_payment is not set, refunds the amounts the user has already paid us to send us messages (directly or via a monoforum).

        require_payment (``bool``, *optional*):
            If set, requires the user to pay in order to send us messages. Can only be set by monoforums, not users, i.e. parent_peer must be set if this flag is set; users must instead use the inputPrivacyKeyNoPaidMessages privacy setting to remove a previously added exemption. If not set, allows the user to send us messages without paying (can be unset by both monoforums and users).

        parent_peer (:obj:`InputPeer <hydrogram.raw.base.InputPeer>`, *optional*):
            If set, applies the setting within the monoforum aka direct messages » (pass the ID of the monoforum, not the ID of the associated channel).
