    Details:
        - Layer: ``223``

    Parameters:
        id (:obj:`InputDocument <hydrogram.raw.base.InputDocument>`):
            The song to add or remove; can be an already added song when reordering songs with after_id. Adding an already added song will never re-add it, only move it to the top of the song list (or after the song passed in after_id).
